# Property decorator is used to define a method as a property and it can be accessed as an attribute

# by property we can add additional logic when to read write or delete code 

# @property gives you getter setter or deleter method
"""
What is a property() method:
~>The property method lets a method to be called as an attribute.
~> It provides a better way to implement encapsulation i.e. A better way to implement Getter and Setters

Parameters of property():
    ~>fget() used to get the value of attribute.
    ~>fset() used to set the value of attribute.
    ~>fdel() used to delete the attribute value.
    ~>doc() string that contains the documentation (docstring) for the attribute.

What is a @property decorator:
~> The property decorator is a decorator for property method of the class
~> It provides a cleaner way to use property().

    Syntax of @property:

    Why the @lenght.getter isn't needed?
    ~>The @property decorator is basically a syntactic sugar for property().

    ~> Now lenght is property and where the setter is defined. And it is the first method that the @property expects
